Hello, My name is Kapil Kadge and I am a graduate student at Northeastern

My portfolio website - https://kapilkadge.com/

Working with React-Native is a new experience for me. It is very interesting, and I wanted to learn more about React Native and iOS app development.

I tried to complete the app, but it is very new for me and I am struck in the process.

I communicated less with Diall because I wanted to learn more about this app on my own.

For this app,
I create an Expo project with commands and then create a QR code to use Expo Go. Then I connect the database to the Application. Add a navigation bar to navigate between pages.
